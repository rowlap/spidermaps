Files in this directory were geocoded by [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/),
then hand-adjusted using https://mapshaper.org/ to fix erronous geocoding,
and to nudge each pinpoint to its (subjective) "best" location.

Why the inconsistent naming for prepositions? (& / and / upon)  
Why do certain maps appear in multiple boroughs?  
We're copying the TfL upstream data, so we do the same.

These files are not referenced directly by the final map, but are built into
a combined geojson file which is minified.
