Good bus maps do exist, but are too hard to discover. This project tries to fix that.

Initially we're only considering London, although there's no reason this couldn't be extended to
other locations if the same map layout exists.

We're talking about [spider maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_map) for London bus routes,
which are the best maps available, and how to quickly find the one.

Options include 
* A browsable map of spider maps
* Maps near me
