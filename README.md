Good bus maps do exist, but are too hard to discover. This project tries to fix that.

Initially we're only considering London, although there's no reason this couldn't be extended to
other locations if the same map layout exists.

We're talking about [spider maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_map) for London bus routes,
which are the best maps available, and how to quickly find the one.

Options include 
* A browsable map of spider maps
* Maps near me

### Anecdote time

I used to live in [an area of Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canal_Dock) which was
heavily developed from industrial to commercial and residential use from the 1990s onwards. I
wanted to find some old maps of the area, so dropped by the [local reference library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_City_Libraries#Dublin_City_Library_and_Archive_branch) where the old maps live.

Unfortunately, the only way to browse the catalogue was in paper form, in a table something like

| OSI Series C | 1909 | Ringsend | Sheet 4 |
| ------------ | ---- | -------- | ------- | 

then ask at the desk for the maps to be brought up from storage. No more than 3 at a time.

I'm convinced, now as then, that the best way to make geodata discoverable is in geographic form.
Unfortunately [the options from TfL](https://tfl.gov.uk/maps_/bus-spider-maps) are search-by-name,
search-by-route, or enumerate by borough.

Quick, what's the locale and borough for the British Museum? 
That's right, it's on the Russell Square map, in Camden.

If you didn't know that, this project aims to help.
